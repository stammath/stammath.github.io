  Praṇāma

  I am a mathematician by hobby. I created this site/blog to pen down the philosophical and spiritual ideas/concepts/thoughts that go through my mind.

  I will also use this site as a repository to store the spiritual and religious music I listen.

  You can contact me by sending an email to coveringspace@gmail.com
