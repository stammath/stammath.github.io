My name is Vikas Srivastava. I am a mathematician by hobby. I created this site/blog to pen down the philosophical and spiritual ideas/concepts/thoughts that go through my mind.

I will also use this site as a repository to store the spiritual and religious music I listen.

You can contact me by sending an email to coveringspace@gmail.com or by a [personal message on facebook][linke]
