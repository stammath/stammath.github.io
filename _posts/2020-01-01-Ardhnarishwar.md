Shri Ardhanarishwara Stotram

**चाम्पेयगौरार्धा शरीरकायै कर्पूरगौरार्धा शरीरकाय|**  
**धम्मिल्लकायै  च जटाधराय नमः  शिवायै  च नमः शिवाय ||**

Champeya gowrardha sareerakayai,  
Karpoora gourardha sareerakaya,  
Dhamillakayai cha jatadaraya,  
Nama Shivayai cha namashivaya.

My salutations to both Parvathi and Shiva  
To Her whose body shines similar to molten gold,  
To Him whose body shines like the burning camphor,  
To Her who has a well made up hair,  
And to Him who has the matted lock.

**कस्तूरिका कुंकुमचर्चितायै चितारजःपुंज विचर्चिताय  |  
कृतस्मरायै विकृतस्मराय नमः शिवायै च नमः शिवाय ||**

Chitharaja puncha vicharchithayai,  
Kruthasmarayai vikrutha smaraya,  
Nama Shivayai cha namashivaya

My salutations to both Parvathi and Shiva,  
To Her whose body is smeared with musk and saffron,  
To Him whose body is smeared with ashes of a burning ghat,  
To Her whose prettiness radiates love,  
And to Him who destroyed the God of love.

**चलत्क्वणत्कंकण नूपुरायै पादाब्जराज त्फणीनूपुराय ।

Nama Shivayai cha namashivaya.  
  
My salutations to both Prvathi and Shiva,  
To Her who has tinkling pretty anklets,  
To Him who has the king of snakes as anklet,  
To Her who shines with golden anklets,  
And to Him who has snakes as anklets.

**विशालनीलोत्पल लोचनायै विकासिपंके रुहलोचनाय ।

Vikasi pangeruha lochanaya,  
Samekshanayai vishamekshanaya,  
Nama Shivayai cha namashivaya.  
  
My salutations to both Parvathi and Shiva,  
To Her who has eyes as wide as the blue lotus,  
To Him who has eyes as wide as a fully opened lotus,  
To Her who has even number of eyes,  
And to Him who has odd number of eyes.

**मन्दारमाला कलिताल कायै कपालमालां कितकन्धराय ।  
दिव्याम्बरायै च दिगम्बराय नम: शिवायै च नम: शिवाय ॥ ५ ॥**

Kapalamalankitha kandharaya,  
Divyambarayai cha Digambaraya,  
Nama Shivayai cha namashivaya.  
  
My salutations to both Parvathi and Shiva,  
To Her whose hair is decorated with divine flowers,  
To Him who wears a garland of skulls,  
To Her who dresses in great silks,  
And to Him wearing the eight directions.

**अम्भोधर श्यामल कुन्तलायै तडित्प्रभाताम्र जटाधराय |  
निरीश्वरायै निखिलेश्वराय नम: शिवायै च नम: शिवाय ॥ ६ ॥**

Ambhodara syamala kunthalayai,  
Thadithprabha thamra jatadharaya,  
Nireeswarayai nikhileeswaraya,  
Nama Shivayai cha namashivaya.  
  
My salutations to both Parvathi and Shiva,  
To Her who has black hair like the swollen cloud,  
To Him who has copper matted locks like lightning,  
To Her who is the goddess of the mountains,  
And to Him who is the Lord of the universe.

**प्रपंचसृष्ट्युन्मुख लास्यकायै समस्तसंहारक ताण्डवाय ।  
जगज्जनन्यै जगदेकपित्रे नम: शिवायै च नम: शिवाय ॥ ७ ॥**

Samastha samharaka thandavaya,  
Jagat jananyai Jagatheka pithre,  
Nama Shivayai cha namashivaya.  

My salutations to both Parvathi and Shiva,  
To Her whose dance marks the creation of the world,  
To Him whose dance destroys everything,  
To Her who is the mother of the universe,  
To Him who is the father of the universe.

**प्रदीप्त रत्नोज्ज्वल कुण्डलायै स्फुरन्महापन्नग भूषणाय ।**  
**शिवान्वितायै च शिवान्विताय नमः शिवायै च नमः शिवाय ||**

Nama Shivayai cha namashivaya.  
  
My salutations to both Parvathi and Shiva,  
To Her with glittering earrings of gems,  
To Him who wears a great serpent as an ornament,  
To Her who is divinely merged with Shiva,  
And to Him who is divinely merged with Parvathi.

**प्रपंचसृष्ट्युन्मुखलास्यकायै समस्तसंहारकताण्डवाय ।  
जगज्जनन्यैजगदेकपित्रे नम: शिवायै च नम: शिवाय ॥ ७ ॥**

Ethath pateth astaka mistatham yo,  
Bhakthyaa sa maanyo bhuvi deerghajeevi,  
Praapnothi saubhagyam ananthakaalam,  
Bhooyaath sadha thasya samastha sidhdhi  
  
Those who chant this Ardhanarishwara Stotram with bhakthi will be blessed long respectful life and will be blessed with all they wish to to have in their lifetime.
