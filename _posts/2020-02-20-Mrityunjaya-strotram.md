**रुद्रं, पसुपथिं, स्थाणुं, नीलकन्दं, उमापथिं,  नमामि सिरस देवं, किं नो मृत्यु करिष्यथि. 1**  

What can death do to the one,   
Who salutes with his head that god,

And who is the consort of Uma.

“My soul goes towards you,  
And my mind always meditates on you,”

And salute that Samba,  
Who is the inner soul of the destroyer,  
And pray, ”destroy all life’s problems,  
Oh Lord of Yoga, I salute you.”
