भजे व्रजैक मण्डनम्, समस्त पाप खण्डनम्,
स्वभक्त चित्त रञ्जनम्, सदैव नन्द नन्दनम्,
<!--more-->
सुपिन्छ गुच्छ मस्तकम् , सुनाद वेणु हस्तकम् ,
अनङ्ग रङ्ग सागरम्, नमामि कृष्ण नागरम् ॥ १ ॥

I pray Him, who is the ornament to the land of Vraja,
Who cuts off entire sins,
Who pleases the mind of his devotees,
And who is the godly son of Nanda Gopa.
Salutations to the sea like Lord Krishna,
Who decorates his head with peacock feathers,
Who has the sweet sounding flute in his hand,
And who is the music of the ocean of love.

मनोज गर्व मोचनम् विशाल लोल लोचनम्,
विधूत गोप शोचनम् नमामि पद्म लोचनम्,
करारविन्द भूधरम् स्मितावलोक सुन्दरम्,
महेन्द्र मान दारणम्, नमामि कृष्ण वारणम् ॥ २ ॥



Salutations to Him who has lotus like eyes,
Who wins over the pride of the god of love,
Who has broad and ever shifting eyes,
And who consoled the gopas of the worry over the emissary.
Salutations to the elephant like Lord Krishna,
Who lifted the mountain by his lotus soft hands,
Who has a pretty gaze and smile,
And who killed the pride of the great Indra.

कदम्ब सून कुण्डलम् सुचारु गण्ड मण्डलम्,
व्रजान्गनैक वल्लभम नमामि कृष्ण दुर्लभम.
यशोदया समोदया सगोपया सनन्दया,
युतम सुखैक दायकम् नमामि गोप नायकम् ॥ ३ ॥

Salutations to the Lord Krishna,
Who is not easy to get,
Who wears the ear rings of Kadambha flowers,
Who has very pretty smooth cheeks,
And who is the lord of the women of Vrija.
Salutations to the chief of Gopas,
Who grants supreme bliss,
To Yasodha, gopas and Nanda,
And who is the giver of pleasures.

सदैव पाद पङ्कजम मदीय मानसे निजम्,
दधानमुत्तमालकम् , नमामि नन्द बालकम्,
समस्त दोष शोषणम्, समस्त लोक पोषणम्,
समस्त गोप मानसम्, नमामि नन्द लालसम् ॥ ४ ॥


Salutations to the Nanda lad,
Whose lotus like feet is drowned,
Ever truly in my mind,
And who has curls of hair falling on his face.
Salutations to Him who enthralls Nanda,
Who diminishes bad effects of all sins,
Who takes care of the entire world.,
And who is in the mind of every cow herd.


भुवो भरावतारकम् भवाब्दि कर्ण धारकम्,
यशोमती किशोरकम्, नमामि चित्त चोरकम्.
दृगन्त कान्त भङ्गिनम् , सदा सदालसंगिनम्,
दिने दिने नवम् नवम् नमामि नन्द संभवम् ॥ ५ ॥




I bow to him who is the stealer of hearts,
Who incarnated to reduce the weight of the world,
Who helps us cross the miserable ocean of life,
And who is young baby of mother Yasoda.
I bow to the son of King Nanda,
Who has a pair of pretty shining eyes,
Who is followed by bees wherever he goes,
And who is new and newer to his devotees,
Today and everyday.


गुणाकरम् सुखाकरम् क्रुपाकरम् कृपापरम् ,
सुरद्विषन्निकन्दनम् , नमामि गोप नन्दनम्.
नवीनगोप नागरम नवीन केलि लम्पटम् ,
नमामि मेघ सुन्दरम् तथित प्रभालसथ्पतम् ॥ ६ ॥

I salute the kid of all gopas, who is the treasure house,
Of good qualities, pleasure and mercy,
Who is above the needs of mercy,
And who removed all the problems of devas.
I salute the handsome one who is the colour of the cloud,
Who wears yellow coloured silk resembling lightning,
Who appears as a new Gopa every time he is seen,
And who is interested in new antics every time.

समस्त गोप नन्दनम् , ह्रुदम्बुजैक मोदनम्,
नमामि कुञ्ज मध्यगम्, प्रसन्न भानु शोभनम्.
निकामकामदायकम् दृगन्त चारु सायकम्,
रसालवेनु गायकम, नमामि कुञ्ज नायकम् ॥ ७ ॥

I salute Krishna, the lad amidst the vrija land,
Who is pleased and shines like the good sun,
Who is the son of all gopas,
And who is the pleasure of all their hearts.
I salute Krishna, who is the leader of lads of vrija,
Who plays soulful music using his flute,
Who grants pleasures even though he does not want them,
And whose glances are like defenseless arrows.

विदग्ध गोपिका मनो मनोज्ञा तल्पशायिनम्,
नमामि कुञ्ज कानने प्रवृद्ध वह्नि पायिनम्.
किशोरकान्ति रञ्जितम, द्रुगन्जनम् सुशोभितम,
गजेन्द्र मोक्ष कारिणम, नमामि श्रीविहारिणम ॥ ८ ॥

I salute Him who swallowed the fire,
In the gardens and forests of Vraja land,
Who was sleeping in the dreams of the very able gopis.
I salute Him who is with the goddess of wealth,
Who was the cause of salvation of Gajendra,
Who is surrounded by divine glow of youth,
And who shines in all directions.

यथा तथा यथा तथा तदैव कृष्ण सत्कथा ,
मया सदैव गीयताम् तथा कृपा विधीयताम.
प्रमानिकाश्टकद्वयम् जपत्यधीत्य यः पुमान ,
भवेत् स नन्द नन्दने भवे भवे सुभक्तिमान ॥ ९ ॥

Where I live, wherever I exist,
Let me be immersed in your stories,
For always without break,
So that I am blessed with your grace.
That great man who sings this double octet.
Would be born with devotion to Krishna,
In all his births.

ॐ नमो श्रीकृष्णाय नमः॥
ॐ नमो नारायणाय नमः॥
