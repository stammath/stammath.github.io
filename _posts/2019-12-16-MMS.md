Oh darling daughter of the mountain,  
He who keeps thine face adorned by moon,  
In his thought would never face rejection,  
By the bevy of pretty beauties with moon like face,  
In the celestial Indra’s court,  
And so oh Goddess who is held in esteem by Shiva,  
I am sure you would not reject my wishes,  
Oh Goddess who has captivating braided hair,  
Who is the daughter of a mountain.  
And who is the slayer of Mahishasura.

**अयि मयि दीन दयालु तया कृपयैव त्वया भवि तव्यमुमे**  
**अयि जगतो जननी कृपयासि यथासि तथानु मिता सिरते ।**  
**यदु चितमत्र भवत्युररी कुरुता दुरुतापम पाकुरुते**  
**जय जय हे महिषासुरमर्दिनि रम्यकपर्दिनि शैलसुते ॥ २१ ॥**

**Ayi mai deena dayalu thaya krupayaiva, Thvaya bhavthavyam ume,**  
**Ayi jagatho janani kripayaa asi, thatha anumithasi rathe**  
**Na yaduchitham atra bhavathvya rari kurutha, durutha pamapakarute**  
**Jaya Jaya hey Mahishasura mardini , Ramya kapardini, shaila Suthe. 21**  

Victory and victory to you,  
Oh darling daughter of the mountain,  
Please shower some mercy on me,  
As you are most merciful on the oppressed.  
Oh mother of the universe ,be pleased,  
To give me the independence ,  
To consider you as my mother  
And do not reject my prayer even if it is improper,  
But be pleased to drive away all my sorrows,  
Oh Goddess who has captivating braided hair,  
Who is the daughter of a mountain.  
And who is the slayer of Mahishasura.

Jai Maa Durga !!
